# lstm-xor-problem
My attempt (over a year ago) at solving the XOR problem (using LSTM) as outlined by [OpenAI Requests for Research 2.0](https://openai.com/blog/requests-for-research-2/)

You can find the results inside the Jupyter notebook. Use docker to setup the environment and load the notebook.
